### Bank Customer Churn 🏦 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏾

 In this project, we tried to predict which bank customer will leave the bank based on some features. The churn is determine by an attrition rate so we are able to know which customer will likely leave the bank.Based on that, the bank can make proactive actions and reach out to these customers before they eventually leave.
